# HS.fi Dark theme

### 2022-10-18: As of today, [HS has introduced their own dark theme](https://www.hs.fi/info/art-2000009140129.html), and this extension is thus deprecated.</big>

Use native dark theme, found in the menu:

**MVP** Chrome Extension that applies a couple of simple CSS style attributes to [hs.fi](https://hs.fi) to turn it dark, and a theme toggle switch to upper right corner. Also removes ads from articles and main feeds, just because I was too lazy to adjust their color schemes separately. Contributions welcome.

## Howto

1. Download this repository as ZIP (Upper right `Code` button -> Download ZIP)
2. Extract ZIP
3. In Chrome, go to address `chrome://extensions`
4. Enable _Developer mode_ from upper right corner.
5. Click the _Load Unpacked_ button and select the directory `HS-dark-theme` (from the extracted ZIP).

_Removes ads because I'm lazy! I'm too lazy to even update this screenshot with correct button icons!_
