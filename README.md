# HS Dark mode

Chrome Extension that applies a couple of CSS style attributes to [hs.fi](https://hs.fi) to turn it dark. Also removes ads from articles and main feeds, just because I was too lazy to adjust their color schemes separately. Contributions welcome.

## Howto

1. Download this repository as ZIP (Upper right `Code` button -> Download ZIP)
2. Extract ZIP
3. In Chrome, go to address `chrome://extensions`
4. Enable _Developer mode_ from upper right corner.
5. Click the _Load Unpacked_ button and select the directory `HS-dark-mode` (from the extracted ZIP).
